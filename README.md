I am interested in doing a project on identifying communities in the twitter network of people associated with UConn.

**Resources**

- [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org).  Tweepy is an interface to the twitter API through python that I can use to collect
data. (software)

- [Detecting Clusters/Communities in Social Networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6103523/). This is
a review article from the journal Multivariate Behavioral Research that discusses a range of approaches to community detection and that has a lot of references I can use to learn more.

- [Community structure in social and biological networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC122977/) This is a
somewhat old (2002) PNAS article on community detection but it showed up in my search as highly cited so I will take a look.

- [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) is a python package for working with graphs.  I looked in the documentation
and it has preprogrammed functions for some of the common community detection methods so that will make my life easier,
at least to start.

- [How to Scrape Tweets from Twitter](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-59287e20f0f1)

- [Get and work with twitter data in python using Tweepy](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/using-apis-natural-language-processing-twitter/get-and-use-twitter-data-in-python/)  This is a lesson from a collection of open-source earth science projects.  It explains how to use twitter to look for people tweeting about wildfires but it has a lot of code examples explaining how to get information out of twitter.

- [Zachary's Karate Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club) is the wikipedia page on the Karate Club Network.  This network was published in 1977 in the Journal of Anthropological Research by W. W. Zachary in a paper
called [An information flow model for conflict and fission in small groups](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3629752?seq=1). This was basically the start of using mathematical graph theory and computers in this type of social science problem. Note that the link
is to a jstor article so requires permission to access.
